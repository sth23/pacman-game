Next steps for Pacman:
 - Sound effects
 - Adjust board generation to account for screen size (ie pacman size, ghost size, corridor width, block width, etc - all dependent on screen size)
 - Keep track of extra lives @ bottom of screen using 3 small yellow circle sprites
 - Animate pacman (2 semi-circles, frames?)
